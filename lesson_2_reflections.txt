What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden folder containing Git-specific folders and files is created. Without this hidden folder, Git would not be able to track changes.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows me to filter out any files or folders that do not belong under source control, but that are part of my projects. For instance, Python source files belong under source control, but compiled Python does not. Staging allows me to change many files, but only commit a subset at a time.
