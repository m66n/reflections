When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To share or collaborate. To avoid data loss in case of catastrophe.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

My local copy may have changes that are incompatible with the remote version.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is GitHub-specific and allows a clone of a GitHub repository to another GitHub repository. Clones are copies of repositories that may be either local or remote. A branch is an operation on a repository that allows work on a repository to progress in two directions without one affecting the other.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

In case the remote is damaged or lost, at least its last known state is preserved.
